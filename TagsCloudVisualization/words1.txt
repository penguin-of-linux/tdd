Betty
Botter
bought
some
butter
But
she
said
the
butter
bitter
If
I
put
it
in
my
batter
It
will
make
my
batter
bitter
But
a
bit
of
better
butter
Is
sure
to
make
my
batter
better
So
she
bought
a
bit
of
butter
Better
than
her
bitter
butter
And
she
put
it
in
her
batter
And
the
batter
was
not
bitter
So
was
better
Betty
Botter
Bought
a
bit
of
better
butter
Cause
a
bit
of
better
butter
Made
her
bitter
batter
better
