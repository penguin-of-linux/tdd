Betty
Botter
bought
some
butter
but
she
said
the
butter
bitter
If
I
put
it
in
my
batter
it
will
make
my
batter
bitter
but
a
bit
of
better
butter
is
sure
to
make
my
batter
better
so
she
bought
a
bit
of
butter
better
than
her
bitter
butter
and
she
put
it
in
her
batter
and
the
batter
was
not
bitter
So
was
better
Betty
Botter
bought
a
bit
of
better
butter
cause
a
bit
of
better
butter
made
her
bitter
batter
better
